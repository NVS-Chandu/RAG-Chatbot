Absolutely! Here’s a **ready-to-copy, GitHub-friendly README** for your RAG PDF Chatbot repository:

# RAG PDF Chatbot

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that allows users to **ask questions from PDF documents**. It leverages **Groq LLM** for text generation, **Hugging Face embeddings** for document representation, and **ChromaDB** for efficient vector-based retrieval. A **Streamlit interface** provides an easy-to-use interactive front-end.

---

## Features

* Upload one or multiple PDFs and process them for querying.
* Stores PDF embeddings in **ChromaDB** for efficient retrieval.
* Generates answers using **Groq LLM** combined with relevant document context.
* Interactive interface via **Streamlit**, accessible in Colab using **ngrok**.

## Setup Instructions (Google Colab)

1. **Clone this repository** or upload notebook files to Colab.
2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
!pip install langchain chromadb sentence-transformers PyPDF2 streamlit pyngrok --quiet
```

3. **Set Groq API Key**:

```python
import os
os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY>"
```

4. **Launch Streamlit via ngrok**:

```python
!streamlit run app.py &>/dev/null&
from pyngrok import ngrok
public_url = ngrok.connect(port="8501")
public_url  # Click the URL to open the chatbot
```

---

## Usage

1. Open the public URL generated by ngrok.
2. Upload one or more PDF documents.
3. Wait for the system to process PDFs and create embeddings in ChromaDB.
4. Type your natural language query in the input box.
5. Get answers based on the uploaded PDFs, powered by Groq LLM.

---

## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload** – Users upload PDFs through Streamlit.
2. **Text Extraction** – PyPDFLoader extracts text from PDFs.
3. **Text Splitting** – Text is split into smaller chunks for retrieval.
4. **Embedding** – Hugging Face Sentence Transformers generate embeddings.
5. **Vector Store** – ChromaDB stores embeddings for similarity search.
6. **Query & Response** – User query retrieves relevant chunks; Groq LLM generates answers.

---

## Notes

* **Groq API Key**: Replace the placeholder with your own key. Do **not** include your real key in the repo.
* **ChromaDB**: The database is stored locally (`db/`). Users must upload PDFs to generate it.
* **Colab Ready**: Works in Google Colab with ngrok to expose the Streamlit interface.

You can copy this **as-is** into your `README.md` in your GitHub repo.

If you want, I can also make a **more visually appealing version with badges and code snippets** for GitHub to make it look very professional. Do you want me to do that?
